# Project TippTechGoetter

Goal: Making accurate prediction, what the outcome of a Bundesliga game will be. So either it is a draw, the home or the away team wins. 

To predict as precisely as possible, we implemented two strategies:
1. Use a neural network 
2. Scrape different predictions from various websites in order to have a more accurate prediction
